# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. This was just my attempt of using AI i.e 'antigravity' to build and web app.

- After downloading this repo run `npm i` in the root directory(where the package.json resides)

- And every time you want to run this project run `npm run dev`
